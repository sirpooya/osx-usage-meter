## [3.3.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **German localization**: Full German UI translation, README with language switcher entry, and polished wording for reset-time strings
- **Per-model weekly usage rows**: Show weekly usage for any number of models returned by the API (e.g. Opus, Sonnet, Fable), no longer limited to two fixed slots
